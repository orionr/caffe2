    # Common settings that are necessary to build Caffe2's core functionality.

    # If you want to show a lot of the build details, set VERBOSE_BUILD to True.
    # This will show the detailed commands being run during the build process.
    VERBOSE_BUILD = True
    # Specify your compiler.
    CC = "c++"
    # Specify your archiver.
    AR = "ar"
    # Specify your output folder.
    GENDIR = "gen"

    # Specify if you want to use the system protocol buffer or not.
    # If you have protobuf installed, use the following two lines usually
    # suffice:
    USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF = True
    PROTOC_BINARY = "protoc"
    # Otherwise, use the following line: we will build protobuf using the
    # included source file.
    #USE_SYSTEM_PROTOBUF = False
    #PROTOC_BINARY = 'gen/third_party/protoc'
    # Note for the line above: if you are doing things like cross-compilation,
    # the built protoc compiler will not work on the host, in which case you
    # will need to provide a protoc binary that can run on the host environment.

    # Choose if Caffe2 uses only lite proto or not. Note that this will turn off
    # quite a few capabilities in Caffe2's generated protobuf, notably the text
    # format support. But, if you are using lite proto already, you don't want
    # text format anyway, do you?
    USE_LITE_PROTO = False

    # Eigen: Eigen is a third party library that Caffe2 uses for some numerical
    # operations. If you have eigen installed in your system, you can simply use
    # USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN = True. Otherwise (for example when you are cross
    # compiling) you may want to set USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN to False.
    USE_SYSTEM_EIGEN = False

    # BLAS backend: which backend to use for blas functions.
    # Note that, if the BLAS backend is MKL, we will also assume that the
    # MKL VSL library is present, and we will use the VSL function calls as
    # well.
    # Also note that, if the BLAS backend is eigen, there is actually *no*
    # actual blas function calls. We only routed the caffe-specific functions
    # to use Eigen.
    BLAS_BACKEND = "eigen"

    # google-glog: Caffe can choose to use google glog, which will allow a more
    # sophisticated logging scheme. It also comes with a minimal logging tool
    # that does not depend on glog. If you wish to use glog, set USE_GLOG to
    # True.
    USE_GLOG = True

    # gflags: Caffe can choose to use google glog, which will allow a more
    # feature complete flags registration mechanism. If you wish to use gflags,
    # set USE_GFLAGS to True.
    USE_GFLAGS = True

    # Whether to use RTTI or not. Note that this might not always work; to
    # disable RTTI means that all your dependencies, most notably protobuf, have
    # to be built without RTTI. If you don't know, leave USE_RTTI True.
    USE_RTTI = True

    # Whether to use openmp or not. Note that currently, a lot of Caffe2's code
    # is not using openmp, but the underlying Eigen library can take advantage
    # of that.

    # Now, the cuda MPI suport is available after certain versions (such as
    # OpenMPI 1.7), but it is possible that the MPI is built without cuda
    # support. We will try to figure out if cuda support is available, but
    # sometimes you may need to manually request MPI operators to go to
    # "fallback" mode: in which case the MPI operations are carried out by CUDA
    # memory copy followed by MPI in the CPU space.
